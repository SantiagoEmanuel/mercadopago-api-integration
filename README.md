## üìù Description

This project is an example of how to integrate Mercado Pago into a website.

It uses React and Node.

The shopping cart component can be viewed at the `/` route.

On the `/` route, you can add products to your shopping cart and click the "Confirm Order" button to send the payment preference to Mercado Pago.

By clicking the "Confirm Order" button, the payment preference will be sent to Mercado Pago.

Once the backend processes the payment preference, you will be redirected to the Mercado Pago page to complete the payment.

By clicking the "Cancel Order" button, the payment preference in Mercado Pago will be canceled.
